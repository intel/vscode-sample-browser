# vscode-oneapi-sample

A pretty straightforward extension that calls `oneapi-cli` for the index of samples and displays them in a tree view

## Getting started
Install Visual Studio Code (at least version 1.34) and open this project within it. You should be able to just hit F5 at that point.

You may also need `npm` installed, and of course `node`
